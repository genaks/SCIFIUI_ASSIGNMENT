Description of the assignment;
User Interface cockpit for a science fiction movie. The opening consists of an arc reactor which illuminates upon initiation of the cockpit. This can be entered by clicking on the arcReactor. Once inside, buttons on the bottom left hand corner control actions and processes within the cockpit. The centre of the cockpit represents a grid of surrounding area. Diagnotic analyses are carried out identifying areas of potential danger which Iron man must get to as soon as possible. 


Instructions; 
To run the program, you simply just run it through netBeans or visual studio. UI can be entered by clicking on the arcReactor. 

How it works;
Buttons on the bottom left hand corner control actions and processes within the cockpit. The centre of the cockpit represents a grid of surrounding area. Diagnotic analyses are carried out identifying areas of potential danger which Iron man must get to as soon as possible. 


What I am most proud of in the assignment;
I am most proud of the moving bars indicating the energy consumption in the cockpit.
